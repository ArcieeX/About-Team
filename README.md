# Focus Fox About-Team Page ðŸ¦Š
## Project Overview
***Focus Fox*** is a productivity and wellness-focused application designed to help users optimize their focus and mental well-being. The app combines task management tools with personalized coaching and emotional support to ensure users stay productive while addressing their emotional and mental health needs.
This project was built during my first hackathon, and it was an incredible learning experience. Working with an amazing team, we were able to conceptualize, design, and build this application under tight deadlines.

`***NOTE***`
This repository contains only my portion of the project, specifically the code I contributed during the development of Focus Fox. The aim is to showcase the structure and features of the project while also adding a splash of my own individual artistic and creative approach. While this version contains core functionality, some features might be simplified compared to the full production version.
The actual Focus Fox application is deployed and accessible here:
